Source code for the C command-line programs listed in Paul A. Dickens' doctoral thesis titled "Flute acoustics: measurement, modelling and design" at University of New South Wales.

Apart from the Makefile which is my addition, the source code in this repository is entirely the intellectual property of Paul A. Dickens and is shown here unmodified, as in the publicly available thesis published by the University of New South Wales.
